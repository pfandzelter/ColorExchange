# ColorExchange

##About
See [original forum post](http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/27085-colorexchange-v11/) for more info.

This is my first plugin ever! I wanted to know how it would look if you exchanged the values of different colors in a pixel, that's why I wrote this plugin.
 
#### What is this?
This plugin takes every pixel and replaces color values inside the pixel. Ever pixel is build from a red, a green, a blue and an alpha value. You choose one of these values and choose, with which value you would like to replace it: Red, Green, Blue, Alpha or Zero (this deletes the color from the pixel).
#### Here is the UI:

#### Do you have some example pictures?
Of course! Here is the original:

And this happens when you replace Green with Blue (as shown in the UI):

#### Why would I need this?
I have absolutely no idea. I just wanted to know how it looks like. Play around with it and produce some crazy pics!

## Installation
Copy the included .dll file (see folder "build") to the plugin folder in the directory where Paint.NET is installed.
